# What This Is
This is a basic rouge-like style game that I'm using to learn a bit more about Godot game development.  

I initially started following Youtube tutorials, but found that I was getting bored / frustrated by not making my own process.

I expect this repository to become a complete mess and for myself to be very inefficient in the way the game is designed, but it is a learning process.
